==== About ====
Validol gives you ability to validate simple
python structures.
I wrote this code to validate JSON requests.


==== Help? Documentation? ====
There are many unittests shipped with the sourcecode. Peek there to find out
how to use validol. From what I can say, usage is very easy and "declarative".
Also, classes have some sort of docstrings.


==== Speed? ====
There is a file called load_tests.py
Try tests from there and see the results.
From what I can say - unless your data has thousands of items you have
no problems.

However, I will give you few tips:
1. Lists and tuples are fastest to validate.
2. Hashes are fast enough (1000 items about 1.3s atm)
3. 'Optional' type is slow as hell in hashes (1000 items about 7s atm)
4. Rest is okay.

If you want to validate incoming JSON objects for your RPC - you should
not worry.


==== Stability? ====
The code is probably far from being bug-free, but as soon as I find a bug I
fix it. There are many tests (more than 50 at the moment of writing this text).
