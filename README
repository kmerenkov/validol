==== About ====
This is a small library which lets you validate structures, something like
DTD for XML, except structure' scheme is valid python code and made of
valid python objects.

==== Why ====
I needed something to perform validation of json objects we use in our
project at work.

==== License ====
See LICENSE file in the same directory as this README

==== Help? Documentation? ====
At the moment of initial commit, there are 40 tests. The day you are reading
this text maybe even more.
You can get idea of how to use it from test cases.

==== Other ====
This library is probably far from being bug-free. It took me few hours to
complete it.
